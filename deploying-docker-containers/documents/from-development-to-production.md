## Development to Production: Things to watch out for

- **Bind Mounts shouldn't** be used in Production!
- Containerized apps might need a build step (e.g. React apps)
- **Multi-Container projects** might need to be **split** (or should be split) across multiple hosts / remote machines
- **Trade-offs** between **control** and **responsibility** might be worth it!
