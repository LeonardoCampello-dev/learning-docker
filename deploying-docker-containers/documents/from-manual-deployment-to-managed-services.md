## "Do-it-yourself" Approach - Disadvantages

We fully "own" the remote machine => We're responsible for it (and it's security)!

Keep essentials software updated

Manage network and security groups / firewall

SSHing into the machine to manage it can be annoying

## Your own remote machines (e.g. AWS EC2)

- You need to create them, manage the, keep them updated, monitor them, scale them etc.
- _Great if you're an experienced admin / cloud expert_

## Managed remote machines (e.g. AWS ECS)

- Creation, management, updating is handle automatically, monitoring and scaling is simplified
- Great if you simply want to deploy your app / containers
