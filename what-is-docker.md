# Docker 🐋

Docker is a container technology: A tool for creating and managing containers

Container = A standardized unit of software

A package of code **and** dependencies to run that code (e.g. Node.js code + the Node.js runtime)

> The same container always yields the **exact same application and execution behavior**! No matter where or by whom it might be executed

> Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers
