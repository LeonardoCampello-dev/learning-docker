## Local Host (Development) vs Remote Host (Production)

Local Host / Development

- Isolated, encapsulated, reproducible development environments
- No dependency or software clashes

## Remote Host / Production

- Isolated, encapsulated and reproducible environments
- Easy updates: Simply replace a running container with an updated one

### Deployment is optional!

It's perfectly fine to use Docker (and Docker Compose) for local development

- **Encapsulated** environments for different projects
- **No global installation** of tools
- **Easy to share** and re-produce
