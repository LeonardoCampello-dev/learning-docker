## Docker vs Docker compose

Repeating long **docker build** and **docker run** commands gets annoying - especially when working **with multiple containers**

**Docker compose** allows you to pre-define build and run configuration in a **.yml** file

`docker-compose up`

- Build missing images and start all containers

`docker-compose down`

- Stop all started containers
